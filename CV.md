*Advisor: Dr. Wen-fai Fong • Northwestern University (Remote)*<br>
- National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
- Analyzed data from the Swift X-Ray Telescope for the afterglows of 81 short gamma-ray bursts
- Reduced Chandra X-Ray Observatory observations of several short GRB afterglows to add to a larger catalog

**WIYN Open Cluster Study** • May 2018-January 2020<br>
*Advisor: Dr. Aaron Steinhauer*<br>
- Undergraduate research assistant
- Observed several star clusters with the WIYN 0.9-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory
