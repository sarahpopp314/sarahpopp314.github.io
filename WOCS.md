## Photometry of Open Clusters NGC 2420 and NGC 2506

Advisor: Dr. Con Deliyannis

I am currently working on a detailed photometric study of two metal-poor open clusters, NGC 2420 and NGC 2506. 
I will be presenting this research at the 243rd American Astronomical Society Meeting in January 2024.

## Undergraduate Research: Open Cluster Photometry

Advisor: Dr. Aaron Steinhauer (Undergraduate Research)

As an undergraduate, I was part of a team that observed several star clusters with the WIYN 0.9m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. I performed UBVRI PSF photometry for these clusters using IRAF.
